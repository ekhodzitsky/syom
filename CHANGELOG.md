## [Unreleased]

### Changed

- Product is a zero-dep AAC library (`cargo add syom`). Output is planar
  `f32` at native rate. Caps: `DecodeOptions::speech()` / `unbounded()`.

### Added

- HE-AAC v1/v2 (SBR/PS) and LATM/LOAS on the same decode path. Committed
  lavc native goldens (max abs ≤ 1 LSB, SNR ≥ 70 dB) for lecture M4A,
  44.1 M4A, ADTS sine, TNS, PNS-heavy LC, HE ADTS/M4A, and LATM.
  Runtime does not spawn ffmpeg.
- Owned IMDCT/FFT (no rustfft). PNS polarity matches lavc PCM.

### Fixed

- MP4 audio `elst.media_time` is honoured (AAC encoder delay).
- Implicit SBR `0x2b7` probe requires `sbrPresentFlag == 1` so LC ASC
  padding `56 e5 00` is not treated as HE.
